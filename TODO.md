## TODO
### Data
* Import data from csv into real database (for example sqlite) with pk, fk and indizes
* Use explicit repository-project (PortfolioCalculator.Repository) to access data

### Classes
* Split "Investment"-Class into 3 Classes (Fonds, Stock, RealEstate), use common interface/abstract class if necessary
* Implement calculation algorithm of the portfolio-value into seperate class and inject repo to access all necessary data
